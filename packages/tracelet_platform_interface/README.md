# tracelet_platform_interface

A common platform interface for the [Tracelet](https://pub.dev/packages/tracelet) background geolocation plugin.

This package provides the abstract classes and types that the platform-specific implementations (`tracelet_android`, `tracelet_ios`) implement.

## Usage

**You should not depend on this package directly.** Instead, depend on `tracelet` which automatically includes the correct platform implementation.

This package is only relevant if you are writing a custom platform implementation for Tracelet.
